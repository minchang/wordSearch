Andrés Manuel López Obrador

Andrés Manuel López Obrador[b] (Spanish pronunciation: [anˌdɾes maˈnwel ˈlopes oβɾaˈðoɾ] (About this soundlisten); born 13 November 1953) (commonly referred to by his initials AMLO) is the 58th and current President of Mexico, in office since 1 December 2018.

Born in Tepetitán, in the municipality of Macuspana,[2] in south-eastern state of Tabasco, López Obrador graduated from the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 1986 following a hiatus from his studies to participate in politics. He earned a bachelor's degree in political science. He began his political career in 1976 as a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in Tabasco. His first public position was as director of the Indigenous Institute of Tabasco in 1977, where he promoted the edition of books in indigenous language and the project of the Chontal ridge. In 1989, he joined the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) and was the party's 1994 candidate for Governor of Tabasco. He was the national leader of the PRD between 1996 and 1999. In 2000, he was elected Head of Government of Mexico City. He left the PRD in 2012 and in 2014 founded the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), which he led until 2017. Often described as a center-left progressive democrat and economic nationalist,[3] López Obrador has been a national politician for more than three decades.[4] Critics have claimed his administration has stumbled in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, attempts to deal with drug cartels and other crime, and the economy has faltered even prior to the pandemic.[5]
